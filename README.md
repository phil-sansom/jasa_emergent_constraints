Code and data for article "On constraining projections of future climate using observations and simulations from multiple climate models" by P.G. Sansom, D.B. Stephenson and T.J. Bracegirdle, published in the Journal of the American Statistical Association, https://doi.org/10.1080/01621459.2020.1851696 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.04139.

The file master.R will run the sampling routines, save the output, and reproduce Figures 1, 4, 5 & 6, and the basic model checking and additional figures included in the supplementary material. All code is commented and should be user readable.
